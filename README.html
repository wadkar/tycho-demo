	<h1>EclipseCon 2014 Tycho Tutorial</h1>
	<h2>Setup/Prerequisites</h2>

	For the tutorial, we'll use a specifically prepared Eclipse Luna M6 distribution:
	<ul>
		<li>You should already have copied the distribution for your operating system and architecture from the USB stick. Note: Only use a 64-bit version if you also have a 64-bit JVM installed.</li>
		<li>Unpack the distribution and start it.</li>
		<li>When prompted for a workspace location, choose any empty or non-existing directory, e.g. by entering the relative path <tt>workspace</tt></li>
	</ul>
	If you want to repeat the exercises after the conference, you could also create the Eclipse installation yourself:
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">Get an Eclipse distribution</a>
			which includes the "Java Development Tools" and the "Plug-in Development Environment", e.g. the "Eclipse Standard" distribution.
		</li>
		<li>Unpack it, start it, and use <tt>Help > Install New Software...</tt> to install <ul>
			<li>"m2e - Maven Integration for Eclipse" from http://download.eclipse.org/releases/luna</li>
			<li>"Eclipse 4 Tools" from http://download.vogella.com/luna/e4tools</li>
			<li>"Tycho Project Configurators" from http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/.m2e/connectors/m2eclipse-tycho/0.7.0/N/0.7.0.201309291400/</li>
		</ul></li>
	</ul>
	<br />

	<h2>Overview: Building an Eclipse 4 RCP application in five step-by-step exercises</h2>

	The hands-on exercises will guide you through setting up a typical Tycho build for an Eclipse 4 RCP application.
	<br />
	<ul>
		<li>We start from scratch with an Eclipse 4 sample application plugin,</li>
		<li>Add a simple unit test to make sure the plugin works, and</li>
		<li>Create a feature for grouping the plugins we want to deliver.</li>
		<li>Then, we create a p2 repository/update site containing our feature(s) and plugins, and</li>
		<li>Finally, we create a ready-to-use distribution archive of our RCP application.</li>
	</ul>
	<br />

	<h2>Exercises</h2>
	The tutorial consist of five exercises:
	<ol>
		<li><a href="exercises/Exercise_01_Create_RCP_Bundle/README.html">Build a Eclipse 4 RCP plugin</a></li>
		<li><a href="exercises/Exercise_02_Add_Test_Fragment/tychodemo.parent/README.html">Build and execute a simple test</a></li>
		<li><a href="exercises/Exercise_03_Add_Feature/tychodemo.parent/README.html">Add a feature</a></li>
		<li><a href="exercises/Exercise_04_Add_P2_Repository/tychodemo.parent/README.html">Add a p2 repository</a></li>
		<li><a href="exercises/Exercise_05_Add_Product/tychodemo.parent/README.html">Build a product</a> (<a href="exercises/Exercise_05_Solution/">solution</a>)</li>
	</ol>
	For each exercise, there are detailed step-by-step instructions with screenshots.
	All steps will also be shown on the projector, but if you should miss a step in the presentation, you can still follow along using these instructions.
	<br />In most exercises, we'll continue to work with the projects and files created in the previous exercise.
	In case you don't manage to complete one of the exercises, there are recovery instructions at the beginning of the each exercise.
	<br />
	<br />If you successfully installed everything under "Setup" above, you can now jump to the
	<a href="exercises/Exercise_01_Create_RCP_Bundle/README.html">first exercise</a>.
